# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system currently produces inconsistent response quality and formatting issues. The first response is typically comprehensive and well-formatted, but subsequent responses become shorter, less detailed, and lose proper hyperlink formatting. Additionally, there are differences between local and cloud deployments that need to be addressed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent response quality across all chat interactions, so that every answer provides the same level of detail and usefulness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks multiple questions in sequence THEN each response SHALL maintain consistent length and detail level
2. WHEN the system generates responses THEN the quality SHALL NOT degrade over subsequent interactions
3. WHEN comparing first and later responses THEN they SHALL have similar comprehensiveness for equivalent question complexity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper hyperlink formatting in all responses, so that I can always click on source references to access original content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates source citations THEN they SHALL always be formatted as clickable hyperlinks [¹](URL)
2. WHEN displaying superscript numbers THEN they SHALL appear as proper superscript characters (¹, ², ³) not bracketed text [¹]
3. WHEN multiple responses are generated THEN hyperlink formatting SHALL remain consistent across all responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want identical behavior between local and cloud deployments, so that the system works consistently regardless of where it's running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running locally THEN the response quality SHALL match cloud deployment quality
2. WHEN switching between local and cloud environments THEN the system behavior SHALL be identical
3. WHEN configuration differs between environments THEN it SHALL be explicitly documented and justified

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain context and retrieval quality across conversations, so that later questions benefit from the same high-quality document retrieval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs multi-query retrieval THEN it SHALL maintain consistent retrieval quality across all queries
2. WHEN filtering and ranking documents THEN the scoring algorithm SHALL produce stable results
3. WHEN generating hypothetical answers (HyDE) THEN the quality SHALL remain consistent for similar question types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear debugging information to identify why response quality varies, so that I can troubleshoot and maintain consistent performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes queries THEN it SHALL log consistent debug information for each step
2. WHEN response quality differs THEN the logs SHALL provide sufficient information to identify the cause
3. WHEN comparing local vs cloud behavior THEN diagnostic information SHALL be available to identify differences
