# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing the streaming response functionality from the Streamlit chat interface. The current streaming implementation causes formatting issues where responses are displayed with H1 headers and creates an unpleasant user experience with the typewriter effect. The goal is to replace the streaming response with a direct, clean display of the complete response.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the chat interface, I want responses to be displayed cleanly without streaming effects, so that the formatting is consistent and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL display the complete response immediately without streaming
2. WHEN the response is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper markdown formatting without H1 header issues
3. WHEN the response is generated THEN the system SHALL NOT use the typewriter effect or word-by-word streaming

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to feel responsive and professional, so that I have a better user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a response is ready THEN the system SHALL display it instantly in the chat message container
2. WHEN the response contains markdown THEN the system SHALL render it properly without formatting corruption
3. WHEN multiple responses are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent formatting across all messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to be cleaner and more maintainable, so that future modifications are easier to implement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the streaming code is removed THEN the system SHALL eliminate the stream_response function
2. WHEN the streaming code is removed THEN the system SHALL remove the st.write_stream call
3. WHEN the streaming code is removed THEN the system SHALL use standard st.markdown or st.write for response display
